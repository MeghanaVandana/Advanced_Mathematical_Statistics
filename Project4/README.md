This project builds a logistic regression model to predict whether preliminary-year students at UMass Dartmouth successfully complete the program.
The dataset includes multiple predictor variables and a binary outcome indicating completion or non-completion.
The goal is to estimate each student’s probability of success using logistic and multivariate logistic regression.
Analysis includes model fitting, interpretation of coefficients, accuracy assessment, and evaluation of predictive usefulness.
The report is written in punchline format, summarizing findings clearly and in non-technical language.
