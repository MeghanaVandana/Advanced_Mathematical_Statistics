This repository contains six statistical and machine learning projects completed for Advanced Mathematical Statistics at UMass Dartmouth. The projects cover core analytical methods: descriptive statistics, effect size, hypothesis testing, clustering, logistic regression, K-nearest neighbors classification, and linear separators leading into support vector machines. Each project uses real datasets, including police shootings, crab molting measurements, student success predictors, and geolocation data. Methods applied include k-means clustering, KNN, logistic regression, linear regression, distance-based analysis, convex hulls, Minkowski hyperplanes, and maximum-margin separators. Reports follow punchline or stepwise format as required, with full code and analysis in appendices.
