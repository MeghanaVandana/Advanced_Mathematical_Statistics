This project applies k-means clustering to two geolocation datasets: political violence in India and police shootings in the U.S.
The goal is to explore natural groupings in the data using spatial distance calculated from latitude–longitude coordinates.
Because clustering is unsupervised, the focus is on interpreting what the discovered clusters mean and why the data separates as it does.
Analyses include distance calculations, cluster formation, visualizations, and explanations of geographic or behavioral patterns.
The report is written in punchline format, giving clear non-technical conclusions supported by exploratory cluster analysis.
