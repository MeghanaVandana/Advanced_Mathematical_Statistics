This project analyzes two datasets—police shooting ages by race and crab shell sizes before/after molting—to compare group differences using effect size and statistical significance.
Effect sizes are measured using cumulative distribution comparisons and Cohen’s d.
Statistical significance is assessed using t-tests or Monte Carlo methods if normality assumptions fail.
Interpretations consider real-world context, data limitations, and additional confounding factors.
The goal is to understand how effect size and significance jointly inform meaningful differences between the studied groups.
