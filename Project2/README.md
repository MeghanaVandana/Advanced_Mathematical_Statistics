This project builds a linear least squares model to predict pre-molt crab shell size from post-molt shell size using real biological data.
The report presents conclusions in clear, non-technical punchline format, with full statistical analysis in appendices.
Analyses include descriptive statistics, normality tests, histogram comparisons, scatterplots, and residual diagnostics.
The model evaluation covers R², residual behavior, heteroskedasticity tests, and comparison of lab vs field crabs.
Cross-validation is used to assess prediction accuracy and determine the most reliable linear model.
