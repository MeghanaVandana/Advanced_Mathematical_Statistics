This project introduces the fundamentals of support vector machines by analyzing labelled points in 2D and 3D to explore linear separability.
Tasks include plotting labeled data, constructing convex hulls, and identifying whether the two classes can be separated by a line or hyperplane.
Students compute both the Minkowski hyperplane and the maximum-margin separator using optimization methods.
The project extends to 3D by mapping points to (x, y, z) where z is the radial distance, then reevaluating class separation.
All work is written as explicit responses to steps (1) through (11), not in punchline format.
